Welcome to my Program :D

As my first Github repository i wanted to make a password generator in 3 different languages!
Those are python, C and C++

Warning! Program might be buggy!
How to run?

To run the python program, open a terminal inside the main folder and type "cd python".
What you want to do next is type "python passgen.py".
The python program will execute in your terminal and you can use it!

To run the C program, open a terminal inside the main folder and type "cd C".
Next type "passgenC.exe" to run the program!
The progran will execute inside your terminal!

Running the C++ program is almost the same process as running the C one.
Open a terminal inside the main folder and type "cd C++".
Next type "passgencpp.exe" to run the program!
Just like the previous programs it will execute in your terminal!

How to use?

All 3 of my programs work the same way.
You first need to input an interger, wich will tell the program how many characters your password is going to consist of.
Next you will need to enter how many of those will be letters.
Next you will need to input how many numbers you want.
And last enter how many special characters you want.
NOTE: The amount of letters, numbers and special characters you input must be equal to the total length of the password!
Last but not least the program will ask you if you want to shuffle / scramble your password.
What that does is scramble the letters, numbers and special characters inside your password wich also makes it more secure!

Last, if you did everything right the program will output your password wich you can copy by selecting it and pressing Ctrl + C.

Is it safe?

Yes! Every single one of the programs are safe to run!
Since you cant look at the code from the .exe files i understand concerns about it being something else, but i can assure it its safe!
If you want to be sure you can compile the program yourself from the source code wich is in the same folder as the program. That way you can see what you're running.
However you will need a compiler for that like GCC or Clang.

Requirements

To execute the python program you will need to have python downloaded!
There are many sources on how to do that wich you can find on youtube.
You can download it from this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

To execute the C program you dont need to install anything!
You can execute it all by itself wich i explained how to do in the How to use part.

For C++ .exe files, you need the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed.
You can do so from here:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170
